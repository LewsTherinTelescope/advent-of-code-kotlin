# Advent of Code in Kotlin
Pretty much what the name says. 
## Usage
First, you'll need to grab your session cookie from the [Advent of Code site](https://adventofcode.com/) by going to `Developer Tools > Storage > Cookies > https://adventofcode.com` and selecting the value labeled `session`, and store it in a file named `.session` in the project root folder. This allows inputs to be downloaded automatically, but must be refreshed after a month.

Then, for each year open `src` and simply copy the `year0000` folder and rename it, and do the same for each day with `day00`.

From there, open up the day's `Main.kt` file, and solve! Run the `main()` function from your IDE when you're done.
